This repository contains my submission for the Fundamentals of Data Analysis project 2020.

## Instructions
In this project you must perform and explain simple linear regression using Python on the `powerproduction` dataset available on Moodle. The goal is to accurately predict wind turbine power output from wind speed values using the data set as a basis.

Your submission must be in the form of a git repository containing, at a minimum, the following items:

1. Jupyter notebook that performs simple linear regression on the data set.
2. In that notebook, an explanation of your regression and an analysis of its accuracy.
3. Standard items in a git repository such as a README.

To enhance your submission, you might consider comparing simple linear regression to other types of regression on this data set. Rest assured, all the above concepts will be explored in lecture videos and other materials in the coming semester.

To run this jupyter notebook file you will need to install Python, ideally through th Anaconda distribution. Then you will need to download this repository to your local device. To open the jupyter notebook from your device, please navigate to the folder containing the notebook in your your command line interface and then type: 

`jupyter notebook`
